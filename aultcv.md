To whom it may concern,  

I am very interested in the Front-End Web Development course at Portland Code School. I currently work at an educational nonprofit which serves a wide national audience. I manage all of the organization's communication projects and activities.  My current responsibilities include: website maintenance, managing our organizational wiki, providing training and support for our programs, developing and distributing marketing material to each of our 44 programs, and creating printed and digital communications such as brochures, eNewsletters and videos.  

I work very well in team settings. My ability to understand and communicate information in diverse ways makes me an effective and efficient collaborator. My previous experience has provided me with a great deal of insight towards the various perspectives and values of different stakeholders in a given project. I am able to see both the creative challenges and the logistics and timelines of a given project, as well as the humans behind it (I like to think this is because I’m ambidextrous). I always keep both the big picture and the individual in mind. 

I really enjoy working with others, but I’m also good at working independently. I am not afraid of teaching myself new skills or learning as I go. Over the last year I inherited many projects that were completely new to me; for example, managing our website and wiki (Confluence based). I’ve been teaching myself how to code using a mix of books and online tutorials. I took a computer science class in college, but the content was fairly dated and we didn’t do very much practical application. I am interested in Code School because I think it will provide me with a much more comprehensive understanding of web development. Right now I am comfortable constructing basic pages using HTML and CSS, but I can’t create anything very impressive (and certainly not in a reasonable amount of time). I want to develop the skills and experience necessary to become a successful web designer. 

Portland Code School was recommended to me by my friend and former colleague Niles Voyer-McGiver. Based on his recommendation and my own research I think your program will be a perfect fit for my learning style and career goals.  I have submitted all of the materials required for the application.  Thank you very much for considering my application and please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
